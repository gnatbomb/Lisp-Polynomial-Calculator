# Lisp-Polynomial-Calculator
 
 This program has many basic polynomial soving functions, with the end goal of performing addition and multiplication on polynomial expressions.
 The program solves the expressions and formats / outputs the answer in standard polynomial format, with higher powers of variables further to the left of lower powers.
 
 The first functions serve the purpose of "cleaning up" messy expressions and solving basic arithmetic. Further expressions use those expressions repeatedly to solve either multiplication or addition problems for polynomials.
 The final functions put it all together so that polynomial expressions can be plugged into the problem without having to differentiate what functions you want to perform onto them.
